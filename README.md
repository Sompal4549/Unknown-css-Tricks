# Unknown-css-Tricks
In this repository I have included how Unknown CSS tricks which are very helpful if you are learning HTML, CSS. 
To change the cursor color we use the "**caret-color**" property.
To overrider the selection color of the selected text we use "**::selection**" selector.
Whenever you use the number type input tag you see the increment and the decrement arrows which you can remove with the help of CSS, whenever you don't need them, with "**::webkit-outer-spin-button**" selector and "**::-webkit-inner-spin-button**" selector and give "**-webkit-apperance:none;**" property to the selector. Arrows will be hidden.
If you want the input to have no border around it then specify the property "**border:none;**" to the input selector.
